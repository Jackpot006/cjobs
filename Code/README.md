# Poincar√© Hyperbolic Embeddings

Hyperbolic embedding is used to create Figure 7 along with Hawkes process results. Code for embedding is modified from https://github.com/facebookresearch/poincare-embeddings. 

# Burst Analysis
Burst detection algorithm (Kleinberg, 2002) and available in the Sci2 Tool (2009) is used to create Figure 6. Data for the code is available in cjobs/code.
