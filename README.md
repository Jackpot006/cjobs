This repository provides code and data access for the paper "Skill Discrepancies Between Research, Education, and Jobs Reveal the Critical Need to Supply Human Skills for the Data Economy":

Data: Contains all data files that can be shared openly.
 
For extracting skills from jobs, courses, and publication data, you will need the following: 
- TextPreprocess: removing stopwords and punctuation.
- Dicts: Lexical resources used in skill extraction algorithms.
- Five different algorithms implementation for skill extraction: ExactMatching, MaxMatching, NgramMatching, StandfordLLDA, and StandfordNER.
- Measurement: performance evaluation of skill extraction algorithms: precision, recall and F1.
