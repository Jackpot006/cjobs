# Skill Discrepancies Between Research, Education, and Jobs Reveal the Critical Need to Supply Soft Skills for the Data Economy

 
This repository provides code and data access for the paper "Skill Discrepancies Between Research, Education, and Jobs Reveal the Critical Need to Supply Soft Skills for the Data Economy":
 
For extracting skills from jobs, courses, and publication data, you will need the following: 
1. Data: soft and hard skills
2. TextPreprocess: removing stopwords and punctuation.
3. Dicts: Lexical resources used in skill extraction algorithms.
4. Five different algorithms implementation for skill extraction: ExactMatching, MaxMatching, NgramMatching, StandfordLLDA, and StandfordNER.
5. Measurement: performance evaluation of skill extraction algorithms: precision, recall and F1.

Contact Xiaozhong Liu <liu237@indiana.edu>, Olga B. Scrivner <obscrivn@indiana.edu>, or  Shutian Ma <mashutian0608@hotmail.com> if there are questions or concerns.

For running Granger causality, Hawkes, Poincar√©, and Kullback-Leibler Divergence, you will need code from the Code directory.
Short descriptions are given in the README file.

Contact James Evans <jevans@uchicago.edu> or Lingfei Wu <wlf850927@gmail.com> if there are questions or concerns.
